#  Existing Problem
Crowdfunding apps like GoFundMe or Kickstarter allow users to create new fundraisers that anyone can contribute to. The fundraiser creator accepts the donations, usually under certain conditions, and then the crowdfunding platform takes a small percentage of the money as their share. Everybody wins.

For a platform like Kickstarter, the fundraising goal must be met by a deadline to release funds. If the goal is met in time, then the fundraiser creator receives the funds for their project, and all the contributorsâ€™ credit cards are charged for the amount they donated. If the deadline passes and the goal is not met, then everyone who contributed gets their money back (or rather, their credit cards are not charged).

Web3 comes with its own transaction layer that allows users to transfer funds held in their crypto wallets. Popular wallets include Coinbase Wallet or MetaMask.

## How is this a solution?
The contract gains when campaign target are met , For situations where campaign target wasnt met , the contract doesnt earn from the campaign . So owner are allowed to withdraw all the raised funds . This create trust in the system to not take changes from an unmet goal.
